# qcomp-project
Code from a third year physics programming assignment.

The goal of this project was to learn about quantum computing and write some code to explore the subject area. Many of the procedures are quite slow and take considerable time to run. The focus of the project was on the numerical methods used to arrive at the results rather than on code efficiency.

Many of the scripts in this repository may refer to non-existent files/data that have not been uploaded due to their size. There is no obvious logical order in which scripts should be used (and many are redundant), although some are dependent on data generated by others. 

Almost all of the important code for the project is contained in futils.py with plot_and_multiprocess.py used to setup the calculations for the final part of the project.
